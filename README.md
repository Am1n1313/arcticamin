# Project: Arctic Amin

Getting Amin into the Arctic by 2/2/2020

##What is this project?

With GitHub's new [Arctic Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o), all active public projects by 2/2/2020 will be put onto tape and then stored underground about 250 meters deep into the permafrost of an Arctic mountain.
We want Amin's face to be apart of those projects going in.

Every day until the 2nd of Feburary, 2020 one Amin picture will have to be uploaded to this repo, we hope that we are successful and we get Amin into the Arctic.

## Why Amin?

Why not.
